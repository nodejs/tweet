## How we approach content for Twitter

Both Social Team members and Node.js project collaborators submitting PRs should approach creating content for Twitter in the same way:

- The language being written should be as precise and clear as possible.
- There should generally be no hashtags contained within, unless they are relevant to real-world events like conferences.
  - Hashtags like #nodejs or #javascript are relatively unused outside of spam at this point, and add no additional semantic value on Twitter.
- We do not amplify or share content that could unduly promote or benefit one corporation that does work in the space of Node.js over another.
- We try to amplify the collaborators who are doing the work rather than anonymously taking credit for it as the project.
  - For general releases, we try to amplify those on the Release Team who are cutting releases directly rather than tweeting release announcements directly from the project's account.
  - For security releases, it is important that the tweet come directly from the Node.js Twitter account (the authoritative source) so that readers will immediately recognize the announcement. Additionally, if there is an announcement tweet from collaborators who put in the effort to make the security release happen, those tweets should also be amplified with a retweet from the Node.js account.
- In situations where a collaborator might become a target for harassment, post from the project account directly.
- We aim to support and amplify ecosystem members who are doing interesting and nice work.

This list should not be expected to be comprehensive nor exclusive, and may be clarified, ammended, or otherwise modified to ensure that the way the Social Team works in the context of our Twitter account is well represented here.

### Other tips for tweets:

- If you are driving folks to a link, place that link at the end of the tweet so that Twitter displays the content as a Twitter Card.
- Are you trying to get people to take some sort of action? (Read blog post, participate in an event, etc...) If so, then make that "call to action" text clear and use encouraging language.

## Process for tweets regarding Node.js releases:

For all major and minor releases, the following process should be done:

1. Retweet canonical tweet from person leading the effort
1. Quote tweet the canonical tweet with the following language: (if possible wait 1-2hrs after step 1, the retweet above)
