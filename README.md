# nodejs/tweet

A repository for the Social Team to manage [@nodejs](https://twitter.com/nodejs) through GitHub and to document how we approach content for the account.

## How we approach content for Twitter

Both Social Team members and Node.js project collaborators submitting PRs should approach creating content for Twitter in the same way:

- The language being written should be as precise and clear as possible.
- There should generally be no hashtags contained within, unless they are relevant to real-world events like conferences.
  - Hashtags like #nodejs or #javascript are relatively unused outside of spam at this point, and add no additional semantic value on Twitter.
- We do not amplify or share content that could unduly promote or benefit one corporation that does work in the space of Node.js over another.
- Where possible, we try to amplify the collaborators who are doing the work rather than anonymously taking credit for it as the project.
  - As an example, we try to amplify those on the Release Team who are cutting releases directly rather than tweeting release announcements directly from the project's account.
  - As an exception, in the case where important or potentially negative content is being shared, using the main account's voice is preferable to both reduce potential negative impact on the indivduals we'd be amplifying and increase the message's signal to end-users (seeing someone you don't know vs. seeing the account have different levels of impact).
- We aim to support and amplify ecosystem members who are doing interesting and nice work.

This list should not be expected to be comprehensive nor exclusive, and may be clarified, ammended, or otherwise modified to ensure that the way the Social Team works in the context of our Twitter account is well represented here.

### Other tips for tweets:

- If you are driving folks to a link, place that link at the end of the tweet so that Twitter displays the content as a Twitter Card.
- Are you trying to get people to take some sort of action? (Read blog post, participate in an event, etc...) If so, then make that "call to action" text clear and use encouraging language.
